### TTS Warning Messages?
- pyttsx3 initialization warnings are normal on some macOS systems
- Voice functionality still works using system TTS (say command)
- No action needed - this is expected behavior

- Check your `.env` file has valid API keys
- Verify internet connection
- Check OpenAI account balance
